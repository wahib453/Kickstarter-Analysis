# An Analysis of Kickstarting Campaigns

***

## Overview of Project

Use Excel advanced tools to visualize and analyze campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals to help Louise, an upcoming playwright, plan and launch their first fund raising campaign for their play, *Fever*. Then write a report of the findings.

## Analysis and Challenges Encountered

### Analysis

Two analysis were performed that are based on theaters outcome from their launched date and set of funding goals for their launching. First analysis performed is observing the consistency of the month or months that had a record of the highest number of theaters launched from 2009 to 2017. The reasoning behind this is the fact that the month that shows the most success of theaters that were launched indicates more plays were performed in that month(s). Second analysis performed is observing the set of campaign goals that made the launching of these theaters possible and successful. For further details, see the following screenshots of th outcomes of the two analysis.

### Challenges Encountered

There were two challenges encountered. First challenge encountered is figuring how to use the Excel CountIFs(). In other to fully know how to use the function, reference materials like online videos were leveraged. Second challenge encountered is that some part of the given instructions were vague. This is problematic because then one is not sure of what he or she knows or what he or she does not know and one is required to complete the project in a short period of time. Thus, by collaborating with other colleagues, the instructions gave good clarity.

## Results

1. What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    * There are significant indications of higher success rates when theaters are launched around **May** than some other months in a year. December shows the worst month to launch a theater.

    * Funding goals set between $0 and $4999 produces 70 percent of success but lower percent of fail compared to goals set between $5000 and above that comes with high percent of fail. For example, goals set between $45000 and $49999 has a 100 percent fail.

2. What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Funding goals set between $0 and $4999 produces 70 percent of success but lower percent of fail compared to goals set between $5000 and above that comes with high percent of fail.

3. What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data is not complete. Some records are missing for the month of December, for example. Another limitation is that there is no record for the year 2009. Thus, these analysis is not complete and may not be recommended to Louise for her campaign funding project.

4. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    * Country vs Pledge
    * Percentage funded vs Goal

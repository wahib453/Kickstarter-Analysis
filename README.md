# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise needs fund for her play titled, Fever. So she organized a fund-raising  campaign to raise some funds. She wanted to know how to go about fully maximizing the campaign.

### Purpose
To leverage the power of Excel in analyzing and visualizating campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals


## Analysis and Challenges
There are two analysis conducted: Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals. Outcomes Based on Launched Date analyzes the Outcomes of launching a theater in a particular month. Outcomes Based on Goals analyzes set of amount goals over percentage successful, failed, and canceled.

The challenges envountered include using the CountIFs() and following the instruction statement. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Theater Launched in May is more successful than other months. December is the month with the lowest success rate recorded. However, it's still higher compare to those that failed and those that got canceled in December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
A goal set between less than a 1000 dollars and $19999 produced unstable success rate. But looking further down the chat, we see a goal set between $35000 and $44999, yielded 67% stable success rate, and any amount above $44999 is 100 percent failure.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The serious challenge I encountered was using the CountIFs(). I was not sure as to how to go about typing the syntax. Also, some of the instructions are not vividly stated. 

Watching a video on how to use the CountIFs() and discussing with colleagues helped overcome the challenges. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
There's a higher success rate launching a theater in May than other months.December is seeing as the worst month to launch a theater with about 2% slightly higher than those failed. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
A goal set between $35000 and $44999 is 67% successful and stable than any other goal amount.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data may not represent a real world data and may not be applicable to real world scenario. There are outliers in the dataset


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Country vs Pledge
Percentage funded vs Goal

# An Analysis of Kickstarting Campaigns

***

## Overview of Project

Use Excel advanced tools to visualize and analyze campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals to help Louise, an upcoming playwright, plan and launch their first fund raising campaign for their play, *Fever*. Then write a report of the findings.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis

Two observations were made. One observation is based on the month with the most significant successful theater launched date. The other observation made is based on how different set of funding goals were met. I observed the annual theater launched from 2009 to 2017 and compared between the month with the most or at least successful launched date to the least. Here are the screenshots of the respective launched campaign outcomes:

#### Theater Outcome based on launched date for 2009

The assumption is that the month with the most success launched rate indicates more theaters. Thus more plays were performed. I also observed the set of goals that yield high success rate and lower fail rate. Lower campaign goals attract high success rate.

### Challenges

Two challenges were encountered. One challenge is using the Excel CountIFs(). It required watching some videos to familiarize its syntax. Another challenge encountered is the given set of instructions for the project. Some part of the instructions were vague. So it required asking some colleagues for clarifications.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Theater Launched in May is more successful than other months. December is the month with the lowest success rate recorded. But it's still higher compare to those that failed and those that got canceled in December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

A goal set between less than a 1000 dollars and $19999 produced unstable success rate. But looking further down the chat, we see a goal set between $35000 and $44999, yielded 67% stable success rate, and any amount above $44999 is 100 percent failure.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The serious challenge I encountered was using the CountIFs(). I was not sure about how to go about typing the syntax. Also, some of the instructions are not vividly stated.

Watching a video on how to use the CountIFs() and discussing with colleagues helped overcome the challenges.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
There's a higher success rate launching a theater in May than other months.December is seeing as the worst month to launch a theater with about 2% slightly higher than those failed.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
A goal set between $35000 and $44999 is 67% successful and stable than any other goal amount.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data may not represent a real world data and may not be applicable to real world scenario. Outliers in the dataset.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Country vs Pledge
Percentage funded vs Goal
